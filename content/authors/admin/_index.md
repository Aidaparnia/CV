My research mainly focuses on how social conditions shape our health differently and how these inequalities are sustained over time. I am interested in this area because, in my perspective, health is primarily a measure of how structures of oppression work in society. These structures are complex, have many dimensions, and work in conjunction with each other. This means that when we try to understand how structures of white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, or capitalism affect our lives, the economic and social outcomes show us one way that these structures operate while health captures their total influence. Based on this idea, health seemed like a good starting point for studying these systems. I am more specifically interested in migration as an experience that shapes a particular encounter with these structures and forces us to consider all of these dynamics globally. So, I study the health of migrants.
